# Flight Data Analysis Program

## Overview

This program processes flight data from a CSV file and performs various analyses on it. The program utilizes methods from the `MyDataReader` and `MyAnalyzer` classes to read and analyze flight data, including details about flights, airports, and passenger statistics.

## Features

- **Read Flight Data**: Reads flight information from a CSV file.
- **Print Flight Details**: Outputs details for all flights, including origin, destination, number of seats, passengers, distance, and date/time.
- **Analyze Airports**: Identifies unique airports located in Maine (ME).
- **Passenger Statistics**: 
  - Finds the maximum number of passengers on flights arriving at Portland International Jetport (PWM).
  - Calculates the percentage of flights that are fully booked (no empty seats).
  - Computes the average number of passengers on flights from PWM to Florida (FL) during the year 2009.

## Classes

- `program1`: The main class that orchestrates reading flight data and performing analyses.
- `MyDataReader`: Responsible for reading data from the CSV file and parsing it into `Flight` objects.
